# Social-Audio is an audio-based social media app. No texts, no video, no images, just audio. It feels like a podcast where multiple people are allowed to speak about a topic or have hangouts without the need to share pictures, videos, or texts – All interaction is audio-based.
# Additionally, Social-Audio looks more like a story, where the content is live and not yet in a recorded format. Overall, Social- Audio looks like a modern version of radio, where social interaction is a key component.
# People can freely for digital audio rooms where they can talk about anything. Those virtual audio rooms are managed by a few moderators working as hosts. Some people can participate in the session by speaking up and many others can just join in to listen to the conversation.

# According to the creators, “Social-Audio is a revolutionary social product based on the voice that allows people everywhere to talk, tell stories, develop ideas, deepen friendships, and meet interesting new people worldwide.”

# This is just school project for an portfolio nothing else.
